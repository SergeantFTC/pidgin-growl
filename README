Pidgin-gntp is a cool plugin, but it hasn't been updated for 3 years. I'm having major performance issues with it.
I'm certainly not a very good coder, but I am somewhat familiar with C, so I'm going to see if I can figure out the
source code and fix the performance issues. 


Original readme describing how to build it:

Requires pidgin source to build.
http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Installing%20Pidgin#Compiling

compile from '\PIDGIN_VERSION\pidgin\plugins\pidgin_growl' folder
